## How to contribute
- Pick a task from the taskboard and pass it to `TODO`
- When you start working pass it to `In Progress` so other people don't work on the same task.
- Make a branch e.g `git checkout -b task-2/add-readme`
- Commit your changes `git commit -m "[task-2] Your message"`
- Push your branch `git push task-2/add-readme`
- Create a pull request on github with the description of all the changes made so others can review it.
- Wait for the review
